## Exploring Global Socioeconomic Data 

#Introduction:
This project aims to analyze these data sources to gain insights into global economics, corruption, tourism, and standard of living. The goal is to identify relationships between metrics like GDP, corruption, unemployment, and cost of living. These insights can help guide business expansion decisions and economic policy.

#Data Overview:
The data covers about 100 countries with key metrics like GDP per capita, tourism revenue, unemployment rates, corruption index, and cost of living index. The sources provide recent yearly figures for comparison across countries.

#Analysis Approach:
SQL queries will join data sources by country to uncover insights. Aggregate functions like AVG, MAX, and SUM will analyze the data. Ranking, ordering, and filtering will find top and bottom performers. Visualizations will supplement key findings.

# List of SQL Queries:
1. Join the corruption and cost of living tables to see if there is a relationship between corruption and cost of living.
2. Find the top 10 countries by GDP per capita.
3. Calculate tourism revenue as a percentage of GDP for each country.
4. Join unemployment and corruption to see if there is a relationship.
5. Join corruption and unemployment data to find average unemployment rate by corruption index.
6. Calculate tourism revenue as percentage of GDP to identify most tourism dependent countries.
7. Join cost of living and GDP per capita and calculate purchasing power index as percentage of GDP per capita
8. Average corruption index by region
9. Rank countries by receipts per tourist
10. Unemployment rate differences between countries by year
